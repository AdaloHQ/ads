In order to use the AdMob integration properly on Adalo, there are a few steps the user needs to follow:

First, create an AdMob account through Google. It normally takes a few days for the request to fully go through and be approved - make sure you've recieved an email that confirms your account is ready to go. If the account isn't fully approved, nothing will happen.

Second, once the account is verfied, login and create the app! Navigate to the "Apps" section of the side panel and click "Add App." When asked if your app has been published, click no. You will then be prompted to select whether your app is iOS or Android. Because the AdMob interface differs depending on the platform, you will have to create one version for iOS and one version for Android. Select one version for the first app and then repeat the previous steps to create an app for the other version. Once your app is created, take note of the App IDs and enter them into the Adalo side panel (make sure you fill in the proper fields for iOS and Android). Essentially, you are linking two AdMob apps to one Adalo app 

Third, navigate to the "Ad Units" section of the app. Click "Add Ad Unit" and select "Banner" when prompted for a type. Do this for both the iOS and Android apps. Enter the corresponding Ad Unit IDs into the Adalo side panel (once again, make sure you fill in the proper fields for iOS and Android). Repeat for all ads you want to include in your app. Keep in mind that it usually takes up to an hour for AdMob to fully process the new Ad Unit request.

Fourth, once your Adalo app is published, go back to your AdMob account and navigate to each App's "App Settings." Link the iOS version to your app in the App Store and the Android version to your app in Google Play.


Best Practices:
Make sure to check that all the App and Ad IDs entered are correct! There is no way for Adalo to validate the entered information because we don't have access to your account and the ads only fully take effect once the app is published. Double check that the correct information is in the correct fields.

Don't mix up the Adalo's iOS and Android fields. AdMob works differently depending on the platform, so mixing up information won't work.

Make sure the iOS and Android versions of each app are identical. Each pair should have the same number of Ad Units. 

Don't use the same App or Ad ID more than once - each ID is only meant to be used once. For each new ad, create a new Ad Unit.
